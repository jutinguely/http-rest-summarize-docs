So rather than let the former President play up an 'incomplete and inaccurate narrative' about the classified documents, government lawyers have shown some of them to us. A photo of a spread of classified documents laid out on the floor as evidence at Mar-a-Lago is one of the many tantalizing breadcrumbs included in a new court filing by the DOJ late Tuesday night. We still don't know what's in the documents. The larger picture is coming together. These piecemeal details help form a picture of the case the DOJ could potentially bring against Trump and his associates. Government prosecutors included the photo evidence, presumably taken during the August 8 search of Trump's Florida residence, in a filing that aims to squash his effort to slow down their case.\"\n}",
