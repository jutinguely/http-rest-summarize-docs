        "(CNN)The Department of Justice doesn't want you to believe what former President Donald Trump says about the classified documents found squirreled away at Mar-a-Lago. So rather than let the former President play up an 'incomplete and inaccurate narrative' about the classified documents, government lawyers have shown some of them to us. A photo of a spread of classified documents laid out on the floor as evidence at Mar-a-Lago is one of the many tantalizing breadcrumbs included in a new court filing by the DOJ late Tuesday night. We still don't know what's in the documents. The larger picture is coming together. These piecemeal details help form a picture of the case the DOJ could potentially bring against Trump and his associates. Government prosecutors included the photo evidence, presumably taken during the August 8 search of Trump's Florida residence, in a filing that aims to squash his effort to slow down their case.",
        "Leaders today increasingly turn to big data and advanced analytics in hopes of solving their most pressing problems, whether it’s a drop-off of repeat customers, a shift in consumption patterns, or an attempt to reach new markets. The prevailing thought is that more data is better, especially given advancements in tools and technologies such as artificial intelligence and predictive analytics. But when it comes to uncovering the motivations and rationale behind individual behaviors within a social system, data can only do so much. It can guide the discovery of a problem, but it won’t determine the solution. In other words, data analytics can tell you what is happening, but it will rarely tell you why. To effectively bring together the what and the why—a problem and its cause, in order to find a probable solution—leaders need to combine the advanced capabilities of big data and analytics with tried-and-true qualitative approaches such as interviewing groups of individuals, conducting focus groups, and in-depth observation. In my conversations with business leaders about how they use data analytics, a primary focus is on technical, large-scale systems. This is where big data and analytics can really shine, in applications such as predictive maintenance. Industrial companies, from railroads to oil fields, use predictive analytics to ensure smooth operations; rather than wait for a mechanical breakdown to occur, predictive maintenance prevents problems and avoids downtime.",
        "ZF had dozens of departments filled with potentially high-impact data-related projects. Although we were tempted to tackle many projects across the entire company, we realized that to create visibility within a 146,000-employee firm, we had to focus on the most promising departments and projects first. But how would we define “most promising”? As the goal of the data lab is to create value by analyzing data, we initially focused on the departments that generate the most data. Unfortunately, this didn’t narrow it down a whole lot. The finance, logistics, marketing, and sales departments—as well as production and quality—all produced large amounts of data that could be interesting for data-science pilot projects. However, we knew from experience that the lowest-hanging fruits for high-impact projects in a manufacturing company like ZF would be in production and quality. For years, ZF’s production lines had been connected and controlled by MES and ERP systems, but the data they generated had yet to be deeply tapped. We decided, therefore, to begin by concentrating on production issues, such as interruptions, rework rates, and throughput speed, where we could have an immediate impact.",
        "Is digital technology a democratizing force, allowing smaller, newer companies to compete against giant ones? Or does it provide even greater advantage to incumbents? That question has gotten a lot of attention lately, in response to data showing that the rate of new business creation in the United States has slowed, and that in most industries the biggest firms have higher market share than they did a decade ago. Despite those trends, our research suggests that technology can in fact provide an advantage to small and new firms. In recent research, we studied the adoption of cloud computing across U.S. businesses. Cloud computing is an IT paradigm based on remote access to a shared pool of computing resources. Putting data “in the cloud” essentially means paying someone else to manage it, and then connecting to their servers via the internet to access your data when you need it. It also means you don’t need to analyze this data on your own machines but can “rent” these services on demand. The popularity of cloud computing has exploded during the last half decade. By cutting the fixed costs of computing—avoiding the need to hire IT staff, servers, and hardware—even the smallest firm can satisfy large and unexpected computing needs. For example, KenSci is a small Seattle-based health care–analytics company, which uses machine-learning techniques to analyze hundreds of variables about patients’ conditions to provide real-time predictions about mortality, readmissions, and other health-related risks. Relying on the cloud, KenSci has been able to quickly scale up and offer its services worldwide, without building a sizable IT infrastructure beforehand. The computational agility of cloud computing has been playing a role in manufacturing as well, fostering the creation of new “smart’ ” products. Pivothead is a firm with 25 employees producing wearable technologies to help the blind and visually impaired. Information collected by the wearable sensors is sent to the cloud, processed through machine-learning algorithms, and transformed into speech or text, in order to help the client navigate the surrounding environment. These anecdotes suggest that cloud computing has “democratized computing” by bringing it to the masses of firms. Our research confirms this intuition using a massive new data set of over one million U.S. firms since the 1980s. Specifically, we found three key results. First, cloud computing has seen massive growth. Less than 0.5% of firms had adopted it in 2010, whereas 7% had by 2016, which is an annualized growth rate of almost 50%. Second, the adoption of cloud computing has occurred across the United States, not just in one region—albeit with heaviest and earliest adoption in urban and educated areas. But third, and most strikingly, cloud computing—unlike other technologies like PCs and e-commerce—has been adopted first by smaller and younger firms. The data set for our analysis comes from Aberdeen Information’s call center, which has been making annual phone calls to millions of firms across the United States since the 1980s. It painstakingly records the hardware and software used by millions of firms per year back to 1981. This data set is often used by academic researchers because of its broad coverage and data quality. Surveys aren’t perfect, of course, and one disadvantage of this data is that respondents have discretion over what they consider counts as cloud computing. (Although many internet services these days involve accessing your data from another company over the internet, for the purposes of this survey we expect that firms are responding to a narrower use case: the use of specific enterprise cloud-hosting services such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, IBM Cloud, Oracle, or Alibaba.) In this chapter we use the records from more than 150,000 U.S. firms with information on their adoption of cloud computing."
